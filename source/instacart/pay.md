Drivers have been paid out $200+ million in tips and $68+ million in Power Driver Bonuses so far, and we’re always looking for ways to help them earn more. Here are the most popular ways for Lyft drivers to flexibly increase their income.

### Tips in the Lyft App

Since day one, Lyft has made it easy for passengers to tip right from the app. To date, drivers have earned over $200 million in tips.

After drop-off, the Lyft app charges the passenger for the ride. They’re encouraged to add a tip every time — and the driver keeps the whole amount.

### Weekly Bonuses

The more you drive, the more you earn. Lyft’s weekly Power Driver Bonus rewards drivers for hitting the road when passengers need them most.

Once a driver meets the Power Driver Bonus requirements, we’ll add a bonus to their next weekly deposit. Eligibility varies by city. 

The Power Driver Bonus program rewards drivers with bonuses based on how much they drove in a week. Power Driver Bonus has helped thousands of Lyft drivers earn back most or all of their commissions.

### Instant, Flexible Pay

Express Pay is a first-of-its-kind feature that allows drivers to cash out whenever they want, instantly.

The feature uses push-to-debit technology, which lets drivers access their earnings with a tap of a button after earning at least $50 and paying a $0.50 transfer fee. Most deposits appear right away, depending on the bank.

### Referral Bonuses

Drivers can earn extra money without even getting behind the wheel. If they invite a friend to drive with Lyft, we’ll say thanks with a cash bonus.

We’ve made it easy to refer from the Lyft app. If a friend applies using their referrer’s code and meets a ride requirement, they’ll both get a bonus.

### How Much Do Lyft Drivers Make?

Drivers are paid for the time and distance of every ride. See how that adds up by using our driver earnings calculator.
