### Full Review:
The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) is a real cash-back money maker and the winner of our Credit Card Cash Back Analysis, earning users 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $6,000 in purchases annually, then 1%), 3% at U.S. gas stations and select U.S. department stores as well as 1% on everything else. On top of all these ongoing cash back rewards, you'll get a $200 cash back bonus after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months and will enjoy a 0% intro APR on both balance transfers and purchases. And you can rest assured that you'll be taken care of, as American Express was the top-rated card for customer satisfaction according 2017's J.D. Power credit card satisfaction study. 

First off, you'll get a sweet $200 cash back bonus after spending $1,000 on the card in the first 3 months. And it offers great everyday cash back too, as you'll get 6% back at supermarkets - the highest ongoing cash back rate we've seen, making the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express a terrific choice for anyone who spends a significant amount on groceries. Additionally, commuters and others can take advantage of the generous 3% on gas (no spending cap), and shoppers everywhere will appreciate 3% back (no cap) at select department stores like JCP, Kohls, Macys, Sears and Nordstrom. All other purchases will earn a standard 1% cash back with no cap. 

The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express does have a $95 annual fee, but if you have the spending habits of most people you'll more than earn it back each year (to find out for sure use our free Cash Back Credit Card Calculator). For example, if you spent the maximum amount of $6,000 each year at supermarkets (or $500/month, pretty easy for families to do), you'd get $360 cash back annually just on the groceries you already shop for. If you subtract the annual fee, that's still $265 in cash back each year, and that doesn't include the $200 intro bonus or all the other potential cash back you'd get on gas and other purchases. Or, if you'd prefer a card with no annual fee, consider its sister card the no-fee Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express, which offers similar cash back rewards, a 0% intro APR and a $150 cash back bonus. However, if you spend the same $500 per month at supermarkets with Blue Cash Everyday you'll only earn $180 cash back each year, as opposed to $360 each year with Blue Cash Preferred, so your choice depends on your individual spending patterns. 

On top of all the terrific cash back rewards, Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express features a 12-month 0% intro APR on both balance transfers and purchases. There is a 3% balance transfer fee, but depending upon the interest you're currently paying, it could be more than worth it. Use our free and easy Balance Transfer Calculator to find out. This year-long zero interest period can save you a bunch of money on balance transfers and give you some time to help pay down your balances. It's also a nice perk for new purchases, helping you buy small or large items without having to pay interest on them for 12 month - almost like a free year-long loan! 

The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express also offers purchase protection, return protection and extended warranty. Purchase protection protects items you buy with the card from accidental damage or theft for up to 90 days. Return protection is a safeguard against merchants not accepting a return within 90 days of purchase - if this happens, American Express may refund the full purchase price up to $300 per time ($1,000 max annually). Extended warranty means the terms of the original manufacturers warranty can be extended up to a year, giving you additional peace of mind. 

In sum, the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express is a terrific cash back card with a great $200 cash back bonus, generous ongoing rewards, and a lengthy 0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases. It will particularly appeal to those who spend more on groceries, gas and department stores.
