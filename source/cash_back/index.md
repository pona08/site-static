---

The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express is a great card for you to get cashback rewards on common household categories like purchases at U.S. supermarkets and U.S. gas stations. 

Here is the hightlights:

**BIG SUPERMARKET REWARDS**

> 6% cash back (on up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%) – that means spending $60 a week at U.S. supermarkets could earn over $180 back per year.

**GAS AND DEPARTMENT STORE REWARDS**

> 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and at select U.S. department stores, 1% back on other purchases.

**SIGN-UP BONUS**

> The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express offers a sign-up bonus, something that not all of its cash-back competitors do: $200 statement credit after you spend $1,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 3 months. Terms Apply. That more than covers the annual fee for the first year.
